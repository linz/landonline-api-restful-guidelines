[#218]
== {MUST} contain API meta information
API specifications must contain the following OpenAPI meta information
to allow for API management:

- `#/info/title` as (unique) identifying, functional descriptive name of the API
- `#/info/version` to distinguish API specifications versions following
  <<116, semantic rules>>
- `#/info/description` containing a proper description of the API
- `#/info/contact/{name,url,email}` containing the responsible team

Following OpenAPI extension properties *must* be provided in addition:

- `#/info/x-api-id` unique identifier of the API (<<215, see rule 215>>)
- `#/info/x-audience` intended target audience of the API (<<219, see rule 219>>)



[#116]
== {MUST} use semantic versioning

OpenAPI allows to specify the API specification version in
`#/info/version`. To share a common semantic of version information we
expect API designers to comply to http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[
Semantic Versioning 2.0] rules `1` to `8` and `11` restricted to the format
<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> for versions as follows:

* Increment the **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
after having aligned the changes with consumers,
* Increment the **MINOR** version when you add new functionality in a
backwards-compatible manner, and
* Optionally increment the **PATCH** version when you make
backwards-compatible bug fixes or editorial changes not affecting the
functionality.

*Additional Notes:*

* *Pre-release* versions (http://semver.org#spec-item-9[rule 9]) and
*build metadata* (http://semver.org#spec-item-10[rule 10]) must not
be used in API version information.
* While patch versions are useful for fixing typos etc, API designers
are free to decide whether they increment it or not.
* API designers should consider to use API version `0.y.z`
(http://semver.org/#spec-item-4[rule 4]) for initial API design.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Parcel Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.3.7
  <...>
----

[#215]
== {MUST} provide API identifiers

Each API specification must be provisioned with a globally unique and
immutable API identifier. The API identifier is defined in the `info`-block
of the OpenAPI specification and must conform to the following definition:

[source,yaml]
----
/info/x-api-id:
  type: string
  pattern: ^(internal|public)\-[a-zA-Z0-9]{4,}\-v\d{1,2}$
  description: |
    Mandatory globally unique and immutable API identifier. The API
    id allows to track the evolution and history of an API specification
    as a sequence of versions.
----

API specifications will evolve and any aspect of an OpenAPI specification
may change. We require API identifiers because we want  to support API clients
and providers with API lifecycle management features, like change trackability
and history or automated backward compatibility checks. The immutable API
identifier allows the identification of all API specification versions of an
API evolution. By using  <<116, API semantic version information>> or <<192,
API publishing date>> as order criteria you get the *version* or
*publication history* as a sequence of API specifications.

*Note*: While it is nice to use human readable API identifiers based on
self-managed URNs, it is recommend to stick to UUIDs to relief API designers
from any urge of changing the API identifier while evolving the API. Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-api-id: internal-titles-v1
  title: Parcel Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.5.8
  <...>
----


[#219]
== {MUST} provide API audience

Each API must be classified with respect to the intended target *audience*
supposed to consume the API, to facilitate differentiated standards on APIs
for discoverability, changeability, quality of design and documentation, as
well as permission granting. We differentiate the following API audience
groups with clear organisational and legal boundaries:

**Note**: sub-categorised as **internal**, **partner** and **public** this affects which subdomain deploy the API Proxy
is deployed to in **Tyk Gateway**


*company-internal*::
  The API consumers with this audience are restricted to applications owned
  by Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand
*bff-internal*::
  `Backend for front end` (BFF).
  Used only when a single client connects to a single backend.

  i.e. Only a single client can be assigned scopes to access the API.
*external-public*::
  APIs with this audience can be accessed by anyone with Internet access(unauthenticated).

*Note:* a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group
and thus does not need to be declared additionally.

The API audience is provided as API meta information in the `info`-block of
the OpenAPI specification and must conform to the following specification:

[source,yaml]
----
/info/x-audience:
  type: string
  enum:
    - bff-internal
    - company-internal
    - external-public
  description: |
    Intended target audience of the API. Relevant for standards around
    quality of design and documentation, reviews, discoverability,
    changeability, and permission granting.
----

*Note:* Exactly *one audience* per API specification is allowed. For this
reason a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group
and thus does not need to be declared additionally. If parts of your API have
a different target audience, we recommend to split API specifications along
the target audience — even if this creates redundancies
({api-audience-narrative}[rationale (internal_link)]).

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-audience: company-internal
  title: Parcel Helper Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.2.4
  <...>
----

For details and more information on audience groups see the
{api-audience-narrative}[API Audience narrative (internal_link)].


[#224]
== {MUST} follow naming convention for hostnames ( Under Construction)

x-audience and hostnames are intricately linked. More to come.

[#251]
== {MUST} Provide Gateway Upstream Targets

Configure the API gateway upstream target, i.e., the API Provider. You must specify one upstream target for each environment: *dev*, *preprod*, and *prod*.

These environments align with the enterprise domain naming conventions. For simplicity, consider *nonprod* and *preprod* in the step to relate to *dev* and *env* in the _enterprise_ respectively.

For each environment, the upstream target must adhere to specific URL patterns:
- *prod* and *preprod* environments must use URLs matching the pattern `https://[subdomain].awsint.linz.govt.nz(/.*)?`, where `[subdomain]` represents the respective subdomain.
- *dev* environment must use URLs matching either the pattern `https://httpbin.org(/.*)?`  or the internal subdomain pattern.

**Note:** We acknowledge that because we promote design first, there is some likelihood when creating this document the upstream target is not necessarily known. You can use a subdomain placeholder until you have the final upstream target. e.g. https://placeholder.awsint.linz.govt.nz/

[source,yaml]
----
/x-gateway-upstream-targets:
  type: object
  description: |
     Mandatory extension used to determine upstream targets based on the environment. Ensure that the URLs conform to the specified patterns for each environment.
----

== {MAY} Provide Gateway Upstream Targets for postprod env

When you have postprod environment ready, configure the API proxy with API Gateway upstream target for postprod environment

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-audience: company-internal
  title: Parcel Helper Service API
x-gateway-upstream-targets:
    prod: https://api.enablement.awsint.linz.govt.nz/
    dev: https://httpbin.org/anything
    env: https://api.preprod.enablement.awsint.linz.govt.nz/extra/path
    postprod: https://api.postprod.landonline.govt.nz/v1/auth
<...>

[#252]
== {MUST} provide server url

Configure the API gateway server url for your resource, ensure variables are configured if templating.
URL is dependent on audience, external-public must have public prepended. i.e. public.api.

Usually, a pluralised collection of resource instances is provided at the end of the server URL. The special case of a _resource singleton_ must
be modeled as a collection with cardinality 1 including definition of
`maxItems` = `minItems` = 1 for the returned `array` structure
to make the cardinality constraint explicit.

**Exception:** the _pseudo identifier_ `self` used to specify a resource endpoint
where the resource identifier is provided by authorization information (see <<143>>).

[source,yaml]
----
/servers:
  type: object
  description: |
     Mandatory field used to determine url based on environment.
----

== {MAY} provide optional environment `postprod` for server url

We have introduced an optional environment called `postprod` for API proxies in Tyk i.e. api.postprod.landonline.govt.nz
Specify this environment for the server URL when you have `postprod` env ready

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-audience: company-internal
  title: Parcel Helper Service API
servers:
  - url: "https://api.landonline.govt.nz/v12/myresources"
  - url: "https://api{env}.landonline.govt.nz/v12/myresources"
    variables:
      env:
        enum:
          - .dev
          - .env
          - .postprod
        default: .dev

[#253]
== {MUST} follow the API endpoints design consideration

We secure our endpoints through JWT token validation
You can choose to have a single default scope for each of the endpoints for the resource (API) that you are exposing through the gateway.
Or you can have a separate scope for an endpoint

**Limitation with Tyk while validating for scopes at endpoint level**
There is a limitation with Tyk while validating for scopes at endpoint level and we would need support from teams to work around that limitation
Scope validation at endpoint level fails if we have two endpoints let’s say like below

**/requests/v1/status** (GET)- protected by scope requests:read-status

**/requests/v1/{requestId}** (GET) (where requestId is string) - protected by scope requests:get-request-details

Now both these endpoints are protected by different scopes,
but Tyk can’t correctly validate the scope in this case for the same **operation** and would allow access to **/requests/v1/status**
even when the requests presents a JWT token with scope **requests:get-request-details**

**Reason for that is:**

Tyk uses regular expression in Go to validate a path against a scope but it doesn’t support a negative look-ahead.
Basically, Tyk is not able to achieve this

Allow access to **/any-string-value** but not **/status** for the token with a scope **requests:get-request-details**

**Workaround:**

So teams would have to be conscious to not have a string path parameter and another endpoint with a string in it at the same depth.

**Workarounds Options are**
  * Use an Integer based id, instead of a string
  * Attempt to create a subresource at a separate depth
  * Consider the subresource as a separate resource and hence a separate specification.
