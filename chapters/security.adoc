= REST Basics - Security

Any non public API's must be secured; that is API's exposed via https://api.landonline.govt.nz/.
This will be imply  <<219, x-audience>> has been set to company-internal or bff-internal and <<105, scopes are set correctly>>.

== {MUST} secure API

Non public APIs are protected using JWT Access tokens provided by the platform IAM token service (Currently Keycloak) and must be armed with authentication and authorization.

As part of the API definition you must specify that the API is protected using  `http` typed `bearer` security schemes defined in the
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/[Open API Bearer Authentication] it is based on OAuth2.0 {RFC-6750}[RFC 6750] defining the standard header
`Auhorization: Bearer <token>`.
The following code snippet shows how to define the bearer security scheme.

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
----

[#105]
== {MUST} define and assign permissions (scopes)
At LINZ (STEP) every API must define and set security permissions, also known as "scopes" A decision was made that we would use resource based scopes, so this implies each resource MUST define at least one scope. A scope is a way to limit the type of access that a client has to a particular resource or service by the user whoâ€™s using the app. Scopes MAY be reused between API's if there is a logical service/boundary level (e.g., search, fees) but at least one scope must be defined per resource. (If in doubt check with Security)

The format for scopes follows the regex pattern `[a-zA-Z\-]{4,15}:default`. This means the name of the scope should consist of 4 to 15 alphanumeric characters (or hyphens), followed by `:default`. The `:default` part indicates that these are the default permissions for the respective service.

Scopes are defined as part of the security requirement object at the root level of your API definition, allowing for a default scope that applies to all operations within the API. Please note that currently, only the root security can be set in our system.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
security:
- BearerAuth: [ 'search:default' ]
paths:
  /registeredclients-only-information:
    get:
      summary: Provides information about ...
               Accessible by any user; permissions needed.
----

In the above example, the default scope `search:default` is applied at the root level of the API, allowing access to search operations for any client who has this scope on behalf of the user.

It's critical to understand that any new scope must be https://github.com/linz/landonline-auth/blob/master/docs/how-to-add-new-client-scope.md#adding-a-new-scope[created/configured in the Identity Provider (IDP)] before it can be used by a resource server. Also, the relevant clients must be registered to get that scope. This process is documented in https://github.com/linz/landonline-auth/blob/master/docs/how-to-add-new-client-scope.md[Granting client scope to a client].

Remember that the resource owner squad holds the authority to approve a client registering to a scope. Therefore, always ensure their approval before proceeding with scope creation.

For audiences like the external-public, there's no requirement to define a specific scope. If a single service needs to serve multiple audiences, it's often best to create separate API specifications to manage access control effectively. Refer to <<219, MUST provide audience>> for more details.

== {MUST} validate x-api-rate-limit extension

When using the `x-api-rate-limit` extension in your OpenAPI specification, you must ensure it follows the required structure and validation rules. This extension can be applied at both the `info` level (for API-wide rate limiting) and at individual operation levels.

=== Required Properties

The `x-api-rate-limit` extension must be an object containing the following required properties:

* `enabled` (boolean): Indicates whether rate limiting is enabled
* `rate` (integer): The maximum number of requests allowed (must be greater than 0)
* `per` (string): The time window for the rate limit, specified as a number followed by a time unit (s/m/h/d)

=== Time Unit Format

The `per` property must follow the pattern: a number followed by one of these time units:
* `s` - seconds
* `m` - minutes
* `h` - hours
* `d` - days

Examples: `30s`, `5m`, `1h`, `2d`

=== Operation-Level Requirements

When `x-api-rate-limit` is applied to an operation, that operation *must* have an `operationId` defined.

=== Examples

==== API-level rate limiting:
[source,yaml]
----
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
  x-api-rate-limit:
    enabled: true
    rate: 1000
    per: "1h"
----

==== Operation-level rate limiting:
[source,yaml]
----
paths:
  /search:
    get:
      operationId: searchData
      x-api-rate-limit:
        enabled: true
        rate: 100
        per: "5m"
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success
----

=== Validation Rules

The following violations will be flagged:

* Missing required properties (`enabled`, `rate`, `per`)
* Invalid data types (e.g., `enabled` not boolean, `rate` not integer)
* Invalid `rate` value (must be > 0)
* Invalid `per` format (must match time unit pattern)
* Missing `operationId` when rate limit is applied to an operation
* `x-api-rate-limit` not being an object
