== {MUST} publish OpenAPI specification

All service applications must publish OpenAPI specifications of their
APIs.

An API is published post deployment to the gateway as part of common-cd-oas of the *release bundle artifact*.
This will be a *self-contained YAML*
*files* that each describe one API.

[#193]
== {SHOULD} monitor API usage

Owners of APIs used in production should monitor API service to get
information about its using clients. This information, for instance, is
useful to identify potential review partner for API changes.

Hint: A preferred way of client detection implementation is by logging
of the client-id retrieved from the OAuth token.
